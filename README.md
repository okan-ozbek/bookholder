# **PIXELWARE**
**A freelance development and design agency.**

### Why Pixelware?
As a developer it can be hard to put your seniority into perspective. This project focuses on showcasing my skills as a full-stack developer. The stack used is as follows: PHP, Laravel, Inertia, Vue.js, Typescript, PHPUnit.

### What is the project about?
Pixelware is segmented into two different parts. We have a customer flow as wel as an admin flow, only accounts with proper authorization and authentication can enter this flow. 

**Customer flow** <br>
The customer flow is there to quickly showcase my skills as a developer. Here you are able to find our more about my personality as wel as the diverse array of projects I have been part of and worked on. Clicking on said projects brings the user to a more detailed page where they can read about the challenges, and technologies within the project pipeline.

**Admin flow** <br>
The admin flow is a more complex flow, this is created for authorized accounts. In this flow you are able to find the invoice creation tool. The reason of inception was due to the fact of being able to properly showcase my skills as a developer to the correct audience. <br><br>

Next authorization and authentication are two important aspects of any admin dashboard, the application focuses on keeping security in check with the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 specification. The same standard of protection as most if not all financial institutions. Why? Because it is the best way to showcase my knowledge of safe and clean programming.
